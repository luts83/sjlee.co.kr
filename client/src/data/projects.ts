      <p>
        This research project explored the effectiveness of a Django-based e-learning platform compared to KakaoTalk, a popular messaging app, for online language study groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.
        Over 100 participants engaged in English and Chinese lessons across three months, and their behaviors were analyzed using chat logs, test results, and assignment completion data.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Main Hypotheses:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>h1: Tutorâ€™s feedback increases engagement</li>
        <li>h2: Peer communication increases engagement</li>
        <li>h3: Platform functions impact engagement</li>
        <li>h4: Engagement correlates with academic achievement</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>Key Findings:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>h2 and h4 were supported</strong>: Peer interaction strongly influenced engagement and academic outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>h1 and h3 were not fully confirmed</strong>, suggesting communication features were more critical than tutor feedback or platform design.</li>
        <li>Despite the customised platform being preferred for its structure and feedback archiving, the open communication in KakaoTalk led to higher assignment completion.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>
        <strong>Skills demonstrated:</strong> Data analysis, experimental design, user behavior tracking, full-stack web development, visualization.

        This project focused on analyzing user behavior in online language learning environments using KakaoTalk as the main platform. The analysis included chat message frequency, assignment submission rates, and test scores to evaluate engagement and academic outcomes.

      <h3>Key Focus Areas:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Correlation between number of messages and engagement score (E-Score)</li>
